4	3	this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other .s
3	1	it 's a demented kitsch mess -lrb- although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative -rrb- , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .s
3	3	there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .s
3	3	all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .s
3	3	an interesting story with a pertinent -lrb- cinematically unique -rrb- message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive `` missing thing . ''s

2	3	christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .s

1	0	because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .s
1	3	though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .s
2	1	a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .s
1	2	corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .s
1	1	the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokess
1	3	it 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .s
1	1	a by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .s
0	1	involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .s
1	1	overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .s
1	1	it 's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake .s
1	1	it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .s
1	1	despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .s
0	3	an unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .s
0	1	this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .s
2	2	hey arnold !s
2	1	the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .s

1	3	once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .s
3	1	a working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .s
1	3	if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .s
1	1	there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .s
0	3	it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie .s
4	1	we have n't seen such hilarity since say it is n't so !s
0	1	expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .s
1	1	the cold turkey would 've been a far better title .s
2	1	the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough .s
1	1	the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .s
2	1	the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .s
1	1	zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .s
0	2	try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! 's
1	1	when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .s
2	3	while it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .s
1	3	it treats women like idiots .s
2	1	though catch me if you can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .s
2	1	just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .s
1	1	a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba .s
1	4	impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .s
1	1	for starters , the story is just too slim .s
3	3	so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .s
0	3	the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .s
2	4	the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .s
1	3	it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .s
0	1	almost gags on its own gore .s
0	1	how do you spell clichãƒâ© ?s
3	3	it 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .s
0	3	the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .s
1	1	while -lrb- hill -rrb- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .s
0	1	too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .s
2	1	under 15 ?s
4	2	a giggle a minute .s
2	1	over age 15 ?s
0	0	big fat waste of time .s
2	2	hey arnold !s
0	1	the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .s
1	3	sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .s
0	1	this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .s
0	1	you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .s
1	1	in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .s
1	3	chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .s
0	3	well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .s
1	2	i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .s
2	3	while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .s
2	4	this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash .s
2	1	yes , ballistic is silly .s
0	1	unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .s
2	1	the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .s
1	1	the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .s
1	3	while it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -lrb- sugar hill gang , etc. -rrb- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .s
0	1	not only unfunny , but downright repellent .s
1	3	care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .s
1	1	forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .s
1	1	does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .s
0	1	k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .s
2	1	has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silences
2	3	a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .s
0	3	whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .s
1	1	uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .s
1	0	the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .s
0	1	the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .s
0	1	confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .s
1	1	made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .s
2	1	it 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .s
1	1	holden caulfield did it better .s
1	3	a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .s
1	2	oh come on .s
0	1	like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .s
2	1	if it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .s
2	1	simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .s
1	2	not exactly the bees kneess
1	1	it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28k modem .s
2	1	the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .s
2	3	makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .s
1	1	the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey 's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .s
2	4	jacquot 's rendering of puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .s
2	1	in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .s
1	1	chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .s
0	1	it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .s
2	1	this is nothing but familiar territory .s
1	3	in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .s
0	1	one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .s
1	1	a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .s
1	1	too slow , too long and too little happens .s
0	1	the film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .s
1	1	it 's just filler .s
1	3	sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .s
1	4	utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni 's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .s
1	3	a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line .s
0	3	scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .s
1	1	it 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .s
1	1	they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .s
2	1	barely gets off the ground .s
1	1	even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller 's hand often feels unsure .s
1	3	pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut .s
3	3	at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s .s
0	1	at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .s
1	1	from the opening scenes , it 's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .s
0	1	it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that .s
2	1	on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura 's best work since the xfl .s
2	1	despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -lrb- even , at times , preposterous -rrb- turns , love is just too , too precious in the end .s
1	1	a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -lrb- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -rrb- .s
1	3	by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .s
0	1	too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .s
2	1	dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .s
1	3	manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .s
1	2	do not see this film .s
3	2	minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .s
1	1	delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas .s
1	1	if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday .s
1	1	to call the other side of heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .s
0	1	in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .s
2	1	if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .s
1	1	i 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .s
1	3	without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .s
0	1	it 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -lrb- and who knew they even had any ? -rrb- .s
1	4	while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .s
1	1	for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .s
2	3	to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .s
1	2	what the director ca n't do is make either of val kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .s
1	1	in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .s
0	1	it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .s
2	1	harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .s
1	1	... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .s
1	1	it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation .s
0	3	a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .s
0	1	not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .s
0	1	a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .s
1	1	once -lrb- kim -rrb- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .s
0	2	the words , ` frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .s
2	2	what 's next : `` my mother the car ? ''s
1	1	all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .s
1	1	a sequel that 's much too big for its britches .s
0	1	so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .s
1	1	what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .s
2	3	a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .s
0	3	for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .s
1	1	a coarse and stupid gross-out .s
1	3	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .s
1	1	does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .s
2	3	there 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route .s
0	3	it 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .s
2	3	the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .s
0	1	but the power of these -lrb- subjects -rrb- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .s
1	1	rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .s
1	3	tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .s
0	1	paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma 's scarface .s
1	1	that 's a cheat .s
3	3	harrison 's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .s
0	1	this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .s
1	0	a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .s
1	3	the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter 's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .s
1	1	basically a static series of semi-improvised -lrb- and semi-coherent -rrb- raps between the stars .s
1	1	too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... the isle defies an easy categorization .s
2	3	an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director john mckay can swallow .s
3	3	it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .s
0	1	`` the time machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .s
0	1	it does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .s
1	1	... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .s
2	1	a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .s
2	2	it 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` can this marriage be saved ? ''s
2	3	columns from ladies home journal ...s
2	1	the film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .s
2	2	i 'm sure if you 're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... me , i did n't care for it .s
3	1	it 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .s
2	1	socrates motions for hemlock .s
1	1	the script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman -lrb- the actor -rrb- can make it work .s
2	1	walter hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .s
1	3	it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .s
2	1	it 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .s
2	1	although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .s
1	4	i 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .s
2	2	star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before .s
